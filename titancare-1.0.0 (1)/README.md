TitanCare is the application submission for the DIF Hackathon October 2024. TitanCare is a decentralized application which innovates and digitalizes healthcare by using AI and DID/VC tech. It enhances privacy, security, and user control over their data while integrating and providing multiple crucial health services through the following AI Agents:

Diagnosis Agent: Facilitates global emergency contacts and delivers precise health evaluations based on symptoms.

Treatment Agent: Offers personalized treatment advice encompassing both traditional medicinal and holistic methodologies.

Therapy Agent: Enhances mental health support with coping strategies and cross-platform interoperability.

Fitness Agent: Tailors fitness plans to individual health objectives, illustrating the versatility and adaptability of the AI.

Nutrition Agent: Provides an optimal nutritional meal plan to suit the userâ€™s goals and needs.

Certificate Agent: Awards a digital certificate as VC, acting as an access pass to other applications. (for this project submission, the other application example that the TitanCare VC will act as a passport to is the Titan Cards application, also added to the repository).

Minimize Menu Agent: Allows for having a larger view of the outputs on the screen by minimizing the AI Agents menu at the bottom of the screen.

TitanCare has been made using AIGNE, a no-code AI engine provided by the Arcblock platform. However, the blocklet.json and package zip file (containing: resources folder, screenshots folder, blocklet.ylm, CHANGELOG.md, Logo.png, and README.md) have been included in the repository.
